# Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: Mobile Display Duplication
**Problem**: The main section was displaying duplicated content on mobile view.

**Root Cause**: The index.md file contained extensive duplicated content that was also present in the guide sections, causing the VitePress home layout to display everything twice.

**Solution**: 
1. Simplified the index.md file to only contain the hero section configuration and a brief overview
2. Removed the extensive duplicated content that was causing the duplication
3. Restructured the content to focus on key features and navigation to guides

## Issue 2: Dark Theme Color Contrast
**Problem**: Grey background with light blue font had poor contrast in dark theme, making it difficult to read.

**Root Cause**: The callout components and certain text elements didn't have sufficient contrast in dark mode.

**Solution**:
1. Added specific dark theme styles for callout components in custom.css
2. Improved contrast ratios for info, tip, warning, and danger callouts in dark mode
3. Ensured text remains readable against backgrounds in both light and dark themes

## Files Modified:
1. `/docs/index.md` - Simplified content to remove duplication
2. `/docs/.vitepress/theme/custom.css` - Added dark theme contrast fixes for callouts

## Verification:
- Tested on mobile view - no more duplication
- Tested dark theme - improved contrast for all text elements
- Verified content structure is clean and organized
