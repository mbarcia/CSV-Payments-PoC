/**
 * Reactive service for processing streams of payment outputs and writing them to CSV files.
 * 
 * This service implements a reactive streaming pattern using Mutiny, but with a pragmatic
 * approach to file writing:
 * 1. It collects the stream into a list to work with OpenCSV's iterator-based write method
 * 2. The blocking file I/O is executed on a virtual thread to minimize resource impact
 * 3. As the terminal operation in the pipeline, it doesn't create backpressure issues
 * 
 * The service uses the iterator-based write method from OpenCSV which provides better
 * streaming characteristics than list-based writing, even though we collect the stream
 * for compatibility with the library's API.
