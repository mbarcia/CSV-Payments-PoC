# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a MapStruct-based mapper injection solution for a Quarkus-based CSV payments processing pipeline that resolves CDI dependency injection issues while maintaining compatibility with the existing pipeline framework.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Java 21 with preview features, Quarkus 3.28.0.CR1, MapStruct 1.5.5.Final, Maven, gRPC, Mutiny reactive streams
- **Architecture**: Pipeline Framework with runtime and deployment modules; runtime contains annotations and base classes, deployment contains Quarkus build processors
- **Core Components**: @PipelineStep annotation, GenericGrpcAdapter hierarchy, Steps hierarchy, PipelineProcessor, PipelineApplication, PipelineRunner
- **Build Command**: `mvn clean compile -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dspotless.check.skip=true`
- **Testing Approach**: Use run-e2e-test.sh for integration testing of the complete pipeline
- **Framework Structure**: PipelineApplication and PipelineRunner are generic classes in the runtime module, with build-time configuration controlled via `quarkus.pipeline-framework.generate-cli=true`
- **MapStruct Configuration**: Uses `componentModel = "cdi"` for CDI integration

## Recent Actions
- Identified and fixed MapStruct mapper injection issues by removing @Inject annotations and using static INSTANCE fields
- Fixed compilation errors in PipelineProcessor by correcting upstream variable usage in StepManyToOne interface
- Resolved constructor issues in PaymentProviderServiceMockTest by updating constructor calls to match implementation
- Successfully compiled the project after MapStruct fixes
- Ran end-to-end test and observed successful startup of services (progress from previous failures)
- Identified that services are now starting but pipeline orchestration is not fully functional due to missing generated pipeline application invocation

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Fix MapStruct mapper dependency injection issue where PaymentRecordMapper and other mappers are not being found by CDI
2. [DONE] Resolve compilation errors in PipelineProcessor related to upstream variable usage
3. [DONE] Fix test constructor calls in PaymentProviderServiceMockTest
4. [IN PROGRESS] Complete pipeline orchestration by properly invoking generated pipeline application
5. [TODO] Verify end-to-end test passes with full pipeline execution
6. [TODO] Document the MapStruct integration solution and any configuration changes
7. [TODO] Clean up any remaining unused REST resources that were causing injection conflicts
