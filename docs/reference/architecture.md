# Architecture

The Pipeline Framework is designed as a modular, extensible system for building reactive pipeline processing applications. Understanding its architecture is key to leveraging its full potential.

## Core Concepts

### Pipeline
A pipeline is a sequence of processing steps that transform input data into output data. Each step in the pipeline performs a specific transformation or operation on the data flowing through it.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Data] --> B[Pipeline Step 1]
    B --> C[Pipeline Step 2]
    C --> D[Pipeline Step 3]
    D --> E[Output Data]
    B --> F[Error Handler]
    C --> G[Error Handler]
    D --> H[Error Handler]
    F --> I[DLQ]
    G --> I
    H --> I
```

### Step
A step is a single processing unit within a pipeline. Steps can have different patterns:
- **One-to-One**: Transforms a single input into a single output
- **One-to-Many**: Transforms a single input into multiple outputs
- **Many-to-One**: Aggregates multiple inputs into a single output
- **Many-to-Many**: Transforms multiple inputs into multiple outputs
- **Side Effect**: Performs an operation without changing the data flow

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Step Patterns"
        A[One-to-One] --> B[1 Input → 1 Output]
        C[One-to-Many] --> D[1 Input → N Outputs]
        E[Many-to-One] --> F[N Inputs → 1 Output]
        G[Many-to-Many] --> H[N Inputs → M Outputs]
    end
```

### Mapper
Mappers handle the conversion between different data representations:
- **gRPC objects**: Protocol buffer generated classes
- **Domain objects**: Business logic entities
- **DTO objects**: Data transfer objects

### Adapter
Adapters bridge the gap between the pipeline framework and external systems, handling protocol-specific details like gRPC or REST communication.

## System Architecture

### Runtime and Deployment Modules

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "The Pipeline Framework"
        A[Runtime Module]
        B[Deployment Module]
    end
    
    A --> C[Application Code]
    B --> D[Annotation Processing]
    C --> E[Generated Pipeline Apps]
```

### Runtime Module
The runtime module contains the core framework components:

- **Annotations**: `@PipelineStep` for declarative configuration
- **Interfaces**: Step interfaces (`StepOneToOne`, `StepOneToMany`, etc.)
- **Base Classes**: Abstract implementations and utilities
- **Configuration**: `StepConfig`, `PipelineConfig` for runtime behavior
- **Mappers**: `Mapper` interface and implementations
- **Persistence**: `PersistenceManager` for entity persistence

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Runtime Module"
        A[Annotations]
        B[Interfaces]
        C[Base Classes]
        D[Configuration]
        E[Mappers]
        F[Persistence]
    end
    
    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
```

### Deployment Module
The deployment module contains build-time processors:

- **Annotation Processor**: Scans for `@PipelineStep` annotations
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates gRPC and REST adapters
- **Dependency Injection**: Registers generated beans with the DI container

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Deployment Module"
        A[Annotation Processor]
        B[Code Generator]
        C[DI Registration]
    end
    
    A --> B
    B --> C
```

## Data Flow Patterns

### Reactive Streams
The framework is built on Mutiny reactive streams, supporting both `Uni` (single item) and `Multi` (multiple items) patterns.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input Uni/Multi] --> B[Step 1]
    B --> C[Step 2]
    C --> D[Step 3]
    D --> E[Output Uni/Multi]
```

### Error Handling
Each step includes built-in error handling with configurable retry policies, circuit breakers, and dead letter queues.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Pipeline] --> B[Step 1]
    B --> C{Success?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Next Step]
    C -->|No| E[Retry Policy]
    E --> F{Retry Limit Reached?}
    F -->|No| B
    F -->|Yes| G[DLQ]
```

### Concurrency
Steps can be configured to run with different concurrency models, including virtual threads for high-throughput scenarios.

│   │   └── io/github/mbarcia/pipeline/processor/
│   │       └── PipelineProcessor.java
│   └── pom.xml
└── pom.xml
```

Note that the deployment module is typically used with `provided` scope in application POMs since it's only needed at build time for annotation processing.

## Integration Patterns

### gRPC Integration
The framework automatically generates gRPC adapters for pipeline steps, enabling seamless integration with gRPC-based services.

### REST Integration
REST adapters can be generated to expose pipeline steps as HTTP endpoints.

### Database Integration
Built-in persistence support allows steps to automatically persist entities before processing.

## Configuration Model

### Step-Level Configuration
Each step can be independently configured with:

- Retry policies (limit, wait time, backoff)
- Concurrency settings
- Debugging options
- Persistence behavior
- Error recovery strategies

### Pipeline-Level Configuration
Global pipeline settings control:

- Default step configurations
- Environment-specific profiles
- Monitoring and observability
- Resource allocation

## Extension Points

### Custom Steps
Developers can create custom step implementations by extending the provided interfaces.

### Custom Mappers
Mapper interfaces can be implemented to handle specific conversion requirements.

### Custom Adapters
Additional adapters can be created for new protocols or integration patterns.

## Best Practices

### Step Design
- Keep steps focused on a single responsibility
- Design steps to be stateless when possible
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate recovery mechanisms

### Performance Optimization
- Use virtual threads for I/O-bound operations
- Configure appropriate concurrency levels
- Implement efficient mapper implementations

### Testing
- Test steps in isolation
- Use the framework's testing utilities
- Validate mapper correctness
- Simulate various error conditions
