# Documentation Site Setup Summary

I've successfully set up a documentation site for the Pipeline Framework using VitePress, which is compatible with Cloudflare Pages. Here's what has been accomplished:

## What Was Created

1. **VitePress Documentation Site**: A modern, responsive documentation site in the `docs` directory
2. **Home Page**: The Pipeline Framework README.md is now the home page of the documentation site
3. **Additional Documentation**: Created comprehensive guides for:
   - Introduction to the framework
   - Getting started guide
   - Creating pipeline steps
   - Annotation documentation (@PipelineStep and @MapperForStep)
4. **Navigation Structure**: Configured sidebar and navigation menus for easy access
5. **Deployment Instructions**: Created detailed instructions for deploying to Cloudflare Pages
6. **Local Development Setup**: Configured scripts for running the site locally

## New Features Added

### Search Functionality
- Users can now search across all documentation pages using the search bar in the top navigation
- Powered by VitePress's built-in local search provider

### Multi-Version Support
- Documentation is now organized to support multiple versions of the Pipeline Framework:
  - v0.9.0 (current) - available at the root path
  - v0.8.0 - available at `/v0.8.0/`
  - v0.7.0 - available at `/v0.7.0/`
- Added a versions page that lists all available versions
- Added version indicators to the home page

## How to Use

### Local Development

1. Navigate to the docs directory:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173

### Building for Production

1. Navigate to the docs directory:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. Build the static site:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. The built site will be in `docs/.vitepress/dist`

### Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Cloudflare Pages
2. Use these build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `.vitepress/dist`
   - Build root: `/` , `docs`
3. Deploy!
