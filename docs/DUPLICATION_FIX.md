# Duplication Issue Fixed

## Problem
The homepage was showing duplicated content because I was mixing two different approaches:
1. Using the standard VitePress home layout with frontmatter
2. Using a custom HeroSection component in the markdown content

This caused the same content to be displayed twice - once by the VitePress home layout and once by the custom component.

## Solution
I fixed the issue by:

1. **Removing the custom HeroSection component** from the index.md file content
2. **Using only the standard VitePress home layout** with proper frontmatter configuration
3. **Restructuring the index.md file** to use the built-in VitePress features properly

## Changes Made

### File: `/docs/index.md`
- Removed the custom `<HeroSection>` component usage
- Kept only the standard VitePress frontmatter with `hero` and `features` sections
- Restructured the content to flow naturally after the hero section
- Ensured no duplicated content in the markdown body

### Configuration
The file now properly uses:
- `layout: home` to enable the VitePress home layout
- `hero` section in frontmatter for the hero content
- `features` section in frontmatter for feature cards
- Clean markdown content that follows after the hero section

## Result
The duplication issue is now resolved. The homepage displays:
1. The hero section (from frontmatter)
2. Feature cards (from frontmatter)
3. The main content (from markdown body)

Each section appears only once, eliminating the duplication.
